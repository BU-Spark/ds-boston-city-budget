# CS506 - Data Science Fundamentals
## City of Boston: City Budget Team A
### Group Members: Airi Hatori, Toby Ueno, Deep Patel, Thian Amaraskera, Lucia Kisova


- What is the project focus/overall goal?

The project focus is to study how Boston’s budget is allocated. We aim to analyze questions such as what projects receive the most funding, whether certain geographic areas receive more funding than others and why, how funding allocation has changed over time, and how closely the city actually follows its budget. By answering these questions, we aim to explore how efficiently the city of Boston uses its budget and what needs to change to meet the needs of its citizens.

- Why is this project important?

This project is important because much of the city’s budget is funded by tax money given by its primarily working class citizens. Many people living here are unaware of how their money is being used, and many are also under the impression that their money is not being allocated efficiently. Over the past three years, cost of living has greatly increased and tax funded social services have not risen up to par. By analyzing budget data, as well as demographics on what people, areas, and programs receive more funding than others, we can identify possible changes that can be made to ensure adequate funding is given to the programs which will benefit the majority of citizens.

- What type of data will you collect or be analyzing?

We will be analyzing data obtained from the Boston city government detailing its planned FY2024 recommended budget, funding sources, and project descriptions, broken down by different departments and geographic areas. Additionally, we will look at data to give context to the planned budget, such as change in housing prices, climate conditions, socioeconomic breakdown, and analysis of past years’ budgets.

- What are potential limitations of the project?

Given that this is only a semester-long project, the scope of what we can accomplish is limited as opposed to a research team with much more time and resources. Additionally, our team is made of students who are studying computer science and related fields, and do not have much background in financial analysis. One of the biggest limitations will likely be the scope of the data and possible biases it contains. For example, data on income/socioeconomic status may be biased, as collection processes may not be inclusive to people without access to technology, non-English speakers, and people with disabilities. As with any data, it will be important to be critical in our analysis and identify sources of intentional or unintentional bias in reporting.

- What are your next steps?

The first step for our team is to get familiar with all of the requirements of the project. We will all spend the next few days getting familiar with what we need to produce at the end of the semester and look at all of the information available to us. This includes the recommended operating budget that is also provided. Going through the data together and coming up with a plan for roles and responsibilities will also help our team going forward.
