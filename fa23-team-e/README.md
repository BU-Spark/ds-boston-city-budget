This project is on the analysis and visualization of Boston's city budget. Our team investigated the change in the budget of Boston in different categories, departments, programs, and areas, as well as how it changes over time, and presented our findings through visualization methods.

All of our work is written in Python and presented in jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files. Our analysis in different categories, departments, programs and areas are in category_analysis, department_analysis, program_analysis and area_analysis files, respectively. For our preliminary analysis and data processing, these procedures are included in the preliminary_analysis file. For our analysis of the budget change over time, it is included as the Extention Project file. All results can be recreated by rerunning the provided code.
