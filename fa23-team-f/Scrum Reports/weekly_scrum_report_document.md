## What is the project focus/overall goal?
The focus of this project is to analyze the budget of the City of Boston. Its overall goal is to understand how the city allocates its budget across departments, budget categories, and programs, track changes over time, evaluate geographic distribution of funds, and compare projected versus actual spending. This analysis aims to provide valuable insights into the city's financial management and inform decision-making processes regarding city services and finances.

## Why is this project important?
This project is important since it highlights transparency, accountability, and equitable resource allocation in Boston's annual budget. By analyzing spending patterns across departments, budget categories, geography, and programs, we can make informed decisions, identify disparities, and evaluate program effectiveness. This data-driven approach not only ensures efficient use of public funds but also engages citizens in the budgetary process, fostering trust in government and promoting informed governance practices.

## What type of data will you collect or be analyzing?
We will be analyzing data about the way the city of Boston spends its annual budget, and how this has changed over time. The focus will be on per capita spending by: department, geography, program, and budget category. That is with the goals of analyzing and finding the impact of revenue shifts, socio-economic indicators, and funding sources.
Specifically, we will be collecting and analyzing two primary sets of data pertaining to the City of Boston's budget. The **Operating Budget Data** offers a comprehensive breakdown of annual expenditures, detailing allocations for various departments such as education, police, and housing, and encompassing costs for services and personnel like teachers and firefighters. Meanwhile, the **Capital Budget Data** sheds light on large-scale investments in the city's physical assets. It elaborates on funding sources, from bonds to grants, and provides explicit project descriptions and allocations.

## What are the potential limitations of the project?
Ethical considerations can limit access to certain data especially if it contains private or sensitive information
There could be inconsistencies among how the budgets are recorded each year and this would impact the trends over time.
It might be difficult to compare data during the years because of economic inflation/fluctuations
Creating clear, cohesive visualizations to incorporate trends across different areas like operating vs city budget and various different departments might be a cumbersome task

## What are your next steps? Divide tasks amongst the team (Subject to change)
* Explore Base datasets:
  * Operating Budget Data &rarr; Sofia, teammate, teammate
  * Capital Budget Data &rarr; teammate, teammate, teammate
* Initially explore directions the project could take. -- Each person will take on reviewing a bullet point of the following:
  * Revenue analysis (how has revenue shifts impacted different departments, programs, geographies)? &rarr; Sofia
  * Economic analysis (how has housing cost or rental prices, for example, impacted the cityâ€™s spending on affordable housing? (*note: spark! has a great expert in residence focused on housing). There are a variety of data sets available here and ideas for other economic variables here. &rarr;
  * How have weather changes affected different budget areas, if at all? e.g. snowfall or rainfall or heat levels? &rarr;
  * How have non-tax revenue (e.g. grants, etc.) impacted specific budget areas? &rarr;
  * Socio-economic Data: Supplementary datasets containing socio-economic indicators for different neighborhoods or districts within Boston would enable students to explore potential correlations between the budget allocation and socio-economic factors.. there are also other data sets that are more granular, i.e. smaller geographic units through the census. The city also has the social vulnerability index for folks at most risk of climate disruption impacts. &rarr;
  * Funding Sources Data: This dataset should provide information on the various funding sources used in the capital budget, such as bonds, city funds, and grants (state, federal, or private). It should include details on the amount and type of funding received from each source. &rarr;
  * Departmental Budget Data: Students would need specific budget information for each department within the City of Boston. This data should include the budget allocations, expenditures, and any additional details relevant to the department's operations. &rarr; Everyone
